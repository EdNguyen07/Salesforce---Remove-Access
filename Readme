After several failed attempts using written instructions, this setup was successfully completed by following the YouTube guide: YouTube Video - How to Setup Third Party Account Link in Salesforce

🧩 Objective
Link a Gmail account (via Google OAuth) to a Salesforce user using the Third-Party Account Link feature.

🔧 Prerequisites
Google Developer Console Account

Salesforce Developer Org

📝 Steps to Success
1. Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Console
Go to console.cloud.google.com

Create a new project or select an existing one.

Navigate to:
APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen

User Type: External (if you're using a personal Gmail)

Fill in required fields (app name, email, etc.)

Add test users (your Gmail address)

Go to Credentials → Click Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID

App type: Web Application

Authorized redirect URIs:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://<your-salesforce-domain>.my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Gmail
Save the Client ID and Secret

2. Create an Auth. Provider in Salesforce
Go to Setup → Auth. Providers → New:

Provider Type: Google

Name: Gmail

Consumer Key: (from Google OAuth)

Consumer Secret: (from Google OAuth)

Authorize Endpoint URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth

Token Endpoint URL: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token

Default Scopes: openid email profile

Callback URL: (auto-filled after saving, use this in Google console!)

3. Create Third-Party Account Link (Manually)
Go to the User Record in Salesforce

Under Third-Party Account Links, click New

Provider: Gmail (Auth. Provider you created)

Name: Gmail

Save

🧪 Testing
Make sure you're logged into Gmail

Go back to the User's Third-Party Account Links section and test the connection

If successful, you’ll see the link established!

🔍 Common Pitfalls
⚠️ NO_REGISTRATION_HANDLER error → You're trying to use this as SSO, but the Auth. Provider is for linking accounts, not login. You don't need a registration handler.

✅ Don't forget to add your Gmail to test users in the OAuth consent screen

🔁 Update the redirect URI in Google if you create a new Auth. Provider

🏁 Final Notes
Salesforce cannot directly log you in using Gmail unless you're setting up full SSO, but Third-Party Account Link enables linking Gmail credentials for secure connections and integrations.
